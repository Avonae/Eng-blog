A short note on what this blog is about.

So, I've decided to start a blog. I want to write useful articles for regular people who want to know more about defending themselves in that violent internet space. I've been working in IT for 13 years. I started my work as a 1-st line ISP technical support and then became a system administrator, technical writer, and eventually, business analyst.

This site is more of a convenient archive of articles than a popular portal. But at least there's an RSS feed :D

It's hosted on GitHub Pages, and the repository is [publicly available.](https://github.com/Avonae/Blog).
