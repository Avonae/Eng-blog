Britain [demands that Apple implement a backdoor in iCloud](https://archive.is/3Pp0U) to give intelligence agencies full access to user backups.

This backdoor should allow intelligence agencies to see everything stored in iCloud by any user worldwide. This secret directive was issued last month, and it remains unknown how Apple will respond. Moreover, the directive prohibits Apple from mentioning its existence or informing users that government representatives have access to their data.

This is nothing new and has happened before. In response to similar demands, Apple introduced the "Advanced Data Protection" (ADP) feature in 2022, which expands the list of user data encrypted with end-to-end encryption (E2EE). By default, this list includes 14 items, but after enabling ADP, it expands to 23 items and includes:

- Device backup
- Messages backup
- iCloud Drive
- Notes
- Photos
- Reminders
- Safari bookmarks
- Siri Shortcuts
- Voice Memos
- Wallet passes
So, I recommend all iPhone owners to [enable ADP](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108756). Why not? You lose nothing, only gain security.

Personally, I don’t think Apple will comply with the UK government’s demands — this would severely undermine trust in the brand, and the UK isn’t even part of the EU. It’ll be interesting to see how this unfolds...
