I recently found out that the [streaming platform Twitch](https://publicknowledge.org/twitch-shuts-down-in-south-korea-a-reminder-of-why-we-fight-for-net-neutrality/) has shut down its operations in South Korea. As I dug deeper, I discovered that Twitch's traffic costs in Korea are [10 times higher](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/12/05/an-update-on-twitch-in-korea/) than in other countries. But why?

Since 2016, the Korean government has been trying to change its traffic billing policies by introducing a "Sender pays" system. This means that providers must compensate each other for the traffic exchanged between them. Meanwhile, the client, who actually requests the content, still pays their provider. The idea is to reduce traffic expenses for big consumers like Netflix. However, they seem to forget that Netflix *already* paid for the traffic at its origin. But that wasn’t enough.

As a result, companies in Korea are moving their websites abroad because it's simply cheaper. Why pay ten times the cost in your own country when you can rent a server in a neighboring country for less? It's a rhetorical question.

Consequently, Meta pulled all its servers out of Korea, Netflix spent three years in court fighting with a provider, and Twitch shut down. I’d love to know which is greater — the tax revenue losses from these companies or the supposed benefits of this policy.

We wish them luck in their battle against the free internet and pray this trend doesn’t reach us. You can read more about it [in this article on internetsociety.com](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/internet-fragmentation/south-korea-sender-pays/).
