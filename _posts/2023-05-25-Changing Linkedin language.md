When I first created my Linkedin account, I didn’t even think about setting it up in English. Now that I want to work for an international company, my profile’s primary language is Russian. There’s no obvious way to change it, but there is a not-so-obvious one, and I’m here to share it with you.

My profile had two languages: Russian as the primary, and English as an additional one.

1. **Step one: Back it up.** Every good process starts with a backup. Go to the English version of your profile, click **More > Save to PDF** below your profile picture. This will download your profile as a PDF, so your data won’t be lost. Alternatively, click the “Edit public profile & URL” link on the right. This will open your English profile in a new tab, where you can copy the data you need.

2. **Check your PDF backup.** Open the downloaded file and make sure all the data is intact and in the correct language. I made the mistake of downloading it in Russian and didn’t double-check.

3. **Remove English as a secondary language.** Find the language icon 🌐 in the top-right corner and click it. Then, **delete the English language** by pressing the ❌ next to it. Don’t worry, we’ll add it back soon—that’s why we made a backup!

4. **Add a new language profile.** You’ll now have just one language left in your profile. Click “Add profile in another language” and select **Russian** from the list. Yes, Russian—the language you already have. Linkedin will ask you what the new primary language of your profile should be, and you’ll select English.

And voilà! Your primary profile language is now English, and Russian is the secondary language. You can delete it if you don’t need it.
