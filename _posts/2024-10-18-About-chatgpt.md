There's been a lot of hype around neural networks for a couple of years now. I recently got into ChatGPT and I'm sharing my small experience.

Let me start with a digression. For any client or employer, it doesn't really matter who exactly does the work. What's important is to meet two conditions: do the work, i.e., deliver the required result, and meet the deadlines. That's why many companies create outsourcing chains, delegating tasks to other organizations.

Neural networks are a tool, like an axe. Suppose the task is to chop 30 logs. You can chop them however you like, even with a knife. Often, the number of logs might not be stated, but managers have it calculated based on historical data or by comparing numbers with other employees. You can use an axe and chop 30 logs a day, or you can buy an electric chopper and do it faster. Neural networks are the same: you don't have to use them, but since they exist, why not?

For me, the main challenge is coming up with ways to apply neural networks. So every day I ask myself, "Can it do this?" For me, it's like a fun game—what if it can? And it really can. Recently, I moved all the services I had on my server to Docker and wrote a few PowerShell scripts that saved me about three hours of work. I'm thrilled. It allows me to spend more time on truly important things, like watching Dota streams. Plus, it calls me "boss." How can you resist that?
