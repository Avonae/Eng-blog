Today I woke up to find that a good third of my extensions in Brave had stopped working. Same deal with Chrome. So, what now?

# What Happened
Google rolled out a new version of the API, called "Manifest V3," which puts some heavy limits on ad blockers—and sometimes even makes them unusable. A major casualty of this update is the popular uBlock Origin, which relies on user-updated lists of bad sites. These lists used to update automatically, but Manifest V3 doesn’t allow that anymore. I use Brave, and uBlock Origin still works for now, but who knows for how long.

You can [read more about it the news](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270981/google-chrome-ublock-origin-phaseout-manifest-v3-ad-blocker).

To fix the broken extensions, just head over to the "Extensions" page and click the "Repair" button for each of them. The extensions will be reinstalled.

However, this fix didn't work for Grammarly. Turns out it was straight up removed from the extension store. I couldn’t find any news on why. So, I guess we’re just waiting for updates...
