Phishing is a type of scam designed to lure you onto fake websites to steal your card details and passwords. The most common phishing method is sending out fake emails. These emails are carefully disguised as official company messages, mimicking design and using similar domain names.

I always thought I was immune to such attacks because I was careful about checking the “From” field. But everything has its limits.

I had a laptop delivered from Europe via DHL, and before delivery, I received an email asking me to fill out a customs declaration. It required my details and a payment for the customs fee. I filled it out, paid—everything was fine. Six months later, I received some documents from work, and a similar email showed up in my inbox. The site looked identical: same input fields, buttons, design. I filled it out, sent it off, and then noticed attempts to withdraw money from my card 🤡. That’s when I realized the site was a phishing scam, and I’d fallen into a simple trap. I still wonder how they got information about DHL deliveries. Thanks to SMS confirmation, I didn’t lose any money, but I had to block my card.

To avoid making the same mistakes, here are three tips:

1. **Check the “From” field carefully.** The sender’s email address must be legitimate. If you’re expecting an email from Facebook, the domain should be facebook.com, not [face-book.com](http://face-book.com), [fa.cebook.com](http://fa.cebook.com), or anything similar.
2. **Inspect where the link leads.** The link should direct you to the official website. Don’t trust how a link looks—verify where it actually leads. For instance, I could create a link like [dhl.com](http://facebook.com), but it could redirect you anywhere. Right-click the link > copy the link address, paste it into a notepad, and check.
3. **Use virtual cards for online payments.** This one’s simple—virtual accounts usually have less money, and replacing the card is easier if something goes wrong.

Who relates or agrees? Have you fallen for something like this, or am I the only fool here?)
