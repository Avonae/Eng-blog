Password managers are programs for storing login credentials in encrypted form. As a result, your data will be protected, and you only need to remember one password. In this note, I will tell you about three password managers that I have personally used.

Broadly speaking, password managers can be divided into two types: cloud-based and local. Cloud-based ones store passwords on the company’s servers and are obliviously more convenient; local ones are less convenient but cannot be hacked. I have been using KeePass for 7 years now and can't imagine living without it.

## The most reliable — KeePass

Created in 2003, the [free-for-use KeePass](https://keepass.info/) has gained many followers over the years. It works extremely simply: the database is an encrypted file opened by a master password. The file can be stored on a flash drive or in the cloud, like Google Drive, thereby ensuring cross-platform compatibility. There's an enhanced version — KeePassXC, which uses the same database but has a nicer interface. I recommend trying it out.

* ➕Free; local database (paranoid mode); many plugins available

- ➖Not very convenient — lacks browser integration and cross-platform support out of the box. No shared vaults and a slightly outdated interface.

## A reasonable compromise — Bitwarden

A relatively new solution in the market — a free password manager with open-source code. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) stores passwords on its servers, but you can set up your own. Paranoids rejoice. The interface is nicer than KeePass, but still not very user-friendly. Paid plans provide access to additional features. There's a family plan for $40 per year.

* ➕Free, open-source, cross-platform. Shared vaults are available.
* ➖Non-intuitive interface, passwords stored in the cloud.

## The most convenient — 1Password

A true [enterprise solution](https://1password.com/) for password storage. Here you get a convenient interface, synchronization across all devices, and password sharing. Everything looks beautiful and modern. In my opinion, it's the best on the market. You can purchase a family plan for $5 per month.

* ➕Convenient, beautiful, modern. Cross-platform with shared vaults.
* ➖Quite expensive, doesn't work in Russia. Closed source code and passwords are stored in the cloud.

## Summary

Get yourself a password manager. It's really convenient and secure. Just choose carefully. For example, LastPass has been breached 4 times, so I don't recommend (forbid) using it.
I want to set up a Bitwarden server for myself. After all, browser autofill and cross-platform compatibility do their job well. Stay tuned for the next episodes!
