### What it does:

- 🔁 Automatically syncs events from Google Calendar and tasks from Todoist  
- ✅ Tasks created in Todoist appear in your calendar  
- 📅 Calendar events are mirrored as tasks in Todoist  
- 🧘 No more manual duplication — everything stays in sync automatically

### How it works:

After authorizing with Google and connecting your Todoist account, the app continuously keeps both platforms in sync.  
Any changes you make in one will be reflected in the other.
